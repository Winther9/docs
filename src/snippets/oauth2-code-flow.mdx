If you are registering a new application, you must first save the configuration.

Once you have a saved application registration you may configure the OAuth2 code flow. 

Open the application registration and configure it for the right OAuth2 flow:

1. Enable OAuth2 code flow
2. Copy the generated client secret. 
3. Set the user info response strategy to `plainJson` to enable retrieval of plain JSON user information from the `/oauth2/userinfo` endpoint.

_Note that this is the only time you will be shown the actual value of the client secret_. Criipto only stores this as a hashed value, which means you cannot retrieve the value once it has been generated and stored.

Some libraries do not support the final `userinfo` request. In those cases you will need to fetch the user data directly from the `token` endpoint as opposed to the `userinfo` endpoint. Do this by choosing the appropriate option as shown below.

You may configure Criipto Verify  to retrieve the user information from  either the `userinfo` endpoint - the default option - or you may explicitly choose the `fromTokenEndpoint` in the user info response strategy instead:
