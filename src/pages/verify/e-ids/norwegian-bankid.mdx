## JWT/Token example

```json
{
  "identityscheme": "nobankid-oidc",
  "nameidentifier": "ee9b1bb905a6458e9f3b9d068f1a3765",
  "sub": "{ee9b1bb9-05a6-458e-9f3b-9d068f1a3765}",
  "uniqueuserid": "9578-6000-4-351726",
  "certissuer": "CN=BankID - TestBank1 - Bank CA 3,OU=123456789,O=TestBank1 AS,C=NO;OrginatorId=9980;OriginatorName=BINAS;OriginatorId=9980",
  "certsubject": "CN=CriiptoTest\\, Mikkel,O=TestBank1 AS,C=NO,SERIALNUMBER=9578-6000-4-351726",
  "birthdate": "1946-03-27",
  "socialno": "27034698436",
  "family_name": "CriiptoTest",
  "given_name": "Mikkel",
  "name": "Mikkel CriiptoTest",
  "country": "NO"
}
```
The `socialno` field is the social security number. The `uniqueUserId` identifies the legal person corresponding to the login, and is not considered sensitive.

## Test users

Two types of Norwegian BankID are available:

1. _Web based BankID with a hardware token_. Also called _Netcentric_ accounts, test users from this type of BankID may be created and used on the fly
2. _Mobile BankID_. Norwegian mobile BankID is based on a socalled _SIM card application_ which means you need a special SIM card issued by one of the Norwegian carriers. 

### Creating netcentric test users

Test users are created through the web page at [https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser](https://ra-preprod.bankidnorge.no/#/search/endUser).

1. Go to the "TEST NUMBER GENERATOR" to generate a random, valid SSN
2. It now says "Could not find any bankIDs for ..."
3. Fill out the first name, last name, and BankID friendly name.
4. Click "Order" to initiate the process
5. Once the process complete you now have a test user. User name is the generated SSN, one time password (OTP) is always "otp", and password is always "qwer1234"  

You can test it out at [our authentication demo site](https://verify-login.azurewebsites.net), which is a small sample hosted by Criipto.

### Testing Mobile BankID 

For testing you may order up to three test SIM cards through Criipto once you have signed up for Norwegian BankID.

## Data and consent for Norwegian BankID

### Available data
Basic user information, full name, and date of birth are always made available. Additional data may be requested and is released with explicit user consent only.

| **Data type** | **Released** | **Verified** |
| --- | --- |
| Full name | Always | Yes |
| Date of birth | Always | Yes |
| SSN ("fÃ¸dselsnummer" in Norwegian) | User consent | Yes |
| Address | With user consent | No |
| Email | With user consent | No |
| Phone number | With user consent | No |

Access to the SSN is governed by Norwegian law, as described in the [Ordering Norwegian BankID](/eid-specifics/order-no-bankid) guide.

The unverified data are supplied by end-users and not verified by Vipps or the Norwegian banks.

### Consent model

End-users must explicitly grant consent to releasing the data to you.

The consent model is enforced by Vipps (operator of BankID), and they also provide the consent and data collection dialogs.

### Forced and optional consent

If you request SSN, it will be treated as a required value. End users will not be allowed to complete a login until they have explicitly given their consent to release SSN.

All other additional data are treated as optional values. A login may complete even if the user does not consent to release the requested data.

### Configuration

You can use the Criipto Verify management dashboard [manage.criipto.id](https://manage.criipto.id/providers/NO_BANKID) to configure access to the optional user data, in the **Identity Sources** -> **NO BankID** section.
