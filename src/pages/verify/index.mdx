For an introduction to Criipto Verify and e-ID, you may want to read [the overview](/verify/getting-started/overview) in the Getting Started section.

Criipto Verify supports two distinct use cases supported by most e-ID solutions:

- **Authentication**. All e-ID services supports user authentication. With Criipto Verify you integrate using *OpenID Connect* (aka OIDC). A general introduction to OIDC with Criipto Verify is available in the section on [Using OIDC](/verify/getting-started/oidc-intro).
- **Digital Signatures**. Due to the underlying use of asymmetric encryption by some e-ID services, like the Norwegian and Swedish BankID, digitally signing text is also supported through a proprietary Criipto API. More documentation on this will soon follow, but we have an example of how to program both plain [text signing and PDF signing into your ASP.NET Core app](/verify/signatures/dotnet-core-v3)
