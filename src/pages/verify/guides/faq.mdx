## Unknown Access Code

The `Unknown Access Code` can happen for one of two reasons when trying to fetch information from the `userinfo` endpoint.

1. You are reusing a code, codes can only be used once.
2. Your application OIDC setting `User info response strategy` is set to `fromTokenEndpoint`.

If you are seeing this error in production but it worked in test, make sure that your production application and test application have the exact same OIDC settings.

You can use the copy application feature from test to production to ensure the settings are the same.
