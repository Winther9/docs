## Setting up a test application

To start using the GraphQL examples shown here in our documentation you will need to register a test application to get a set of client credentials.

A signatures application can be registed by:

1. Going to [Criipto Verify](https://manage.criipto.id)
2. Selecting the "Test" environment
3. Navigating to "Applications"
4. Click the button "+ Signatures"
5. Filling out the form and clicking submit

Please store these credentials in a safe location.
