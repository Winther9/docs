## Creating a basic signature order

import {query as createSignatureOrder, Explorer as CreateSignatureOrderExplorer} from '../../../examples/createSignatureOrder.graphql';

Creates a signature order containing PDF documents to be signed.

<CodeBlock text={createSignatureOrder} />
<CreateSignatureOrderExplorer />

## Adding a signatory to a signature order

import {query as addSignatory, Explorer as AddSignatoryExplorer} from '../../../examples/addSignatory.graphql';

Signatories are the individuals you wish to have sign a specific `signatureOrder`. Once created they will have a unique link that you can redirect users to.

<CodeBlock text={addSignatory} />
<AddSignatoryExplorer />

### Evidence validation

import {Explorer as AddSignatoryEvidenceValidationExplorer} from '../../../examples/addSignatoryEvidenceValidation.graphql';

If you wish to validate the user signing you should use the `evidenceValidation` input for `addSignatory`.

Evidence validation keys must match what will be found in the claims token when signing. You can inspect JWT Tokens issued by Criipto Verify to see the necessary keys.

Evidence will be hashed before storage and compared when a user tries to sign. If the evidence does not match an error will be displayed to the user and they will be prompted to try again.

### Document scoping

import {Explorer as AddSignatoryScopedExplorer} from '../../../examples/addSignatoryScoped.graphql';

By using the `documents` input array for `addSignatory` you can limit what documents a signatory will be shown.

<AddSignatoryScopedExplorer />

### Preapproval

import {Explorer as AddSignatoryPreapprovedExplorer} from '../../../examples/addSignatoryPreapproved.graphql';

For scenarios where you are displaying the PDFs to the users in your own UI you can opt to create a signatory with the documents preapproved.

By preapproving documents for a signatory they are immediately sent to e-ID login to sign and skip the frontend approval flow.

When using preapproval document-scoping is automatically used so make sure that you pass all documents from the signature order to the signatory.

## Closing a signature order

import {query as closeSignatureOrder, Explorer as CloseSignatureOrderExplorer} from '../../../examples/closeSignatureOrder.graphql';

When all signatories have signed the signature order you can close it to retrieve your signed PDFs.

<CodeBlock text={closeSignatureOrder} />
<CloseSignatureOrderExplorer />

## Cancel a signature order

import {query as cancelSignatureOrder, Explorer as CancelSignatureOrderExplorer} from '../../../examples/cancelSignatureOrder.graphql';

If for any reason you no longer need a signature order you can abandon it by using `cancelSignatureOrder`

<CodeBlock text={closeSignatureOrder} />
<CancelSignatureOrderExplorer />
