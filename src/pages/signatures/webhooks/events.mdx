Webhooks will be executed as `POST` requests against the URL you have defined on your signature order. The URL will be used as-is, no parameters will be stripped.

The POST request will contain a `JSON` body similar to the events shown below.

You can use the values included in the webhook body to query the GraphQL API for more details.

## SIGNATORY_SIGNED

Triggered when a signatory successfully signs the order.

```
{
  "event" = "SIGNATORY_SIGNED",
  "signatureOrderId" = "[GraphQL ID]",
  "signatoryId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
}
```

## SIGNATORY_REJECTED

Triggered when a signatory rejects the signature order via the UI.

```
{
  "event" = "SIGNATORY_REJECTED",
  "signatureOrderId" = "[GraphQL ID]",
  "signatoryId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
}
```

## SIGNATORY_SIGN_ERROR

Triggered when a signatory experiences an error as part of signing.

```
{
  "event" = "SIGNATORY_SIGN_ERROR",
  "error" = "[ERROR MESSAGE]",
  "signatureOrderId" = "[GraphQL ID]",
  "signatoryId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
}
```
