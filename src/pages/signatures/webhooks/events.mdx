Webhooks will be executed as `POST` requests against the URl you have defined on your signature order.

The POST request will contain a `JSON` body similar to the events shown below.

You can use the values included in the webhook body to query the GraphQL API for more details.

## SIGNATORY_SIGNED

```
{
  "event" = "SIGNATORY_SIGNED",
  "signatureOrderId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
  "signatoryId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
}
```

## SIGNATORY_REJECTED

```
{
  "event" = "SIGNATORY_REJECTED",
  "signatureOrderId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
  "signatoryId" = "[GraphQL ID]"
}
```

## Query example

import * as signatoryWebhookExample from '../../../examples/signatoryWebhook.graphql';

<CodeBlock text={signatoryWebhookExample.query.trim()} />
